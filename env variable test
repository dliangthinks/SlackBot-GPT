# env variables are safe way to store sensitive info instead of leaving them in the code?
# import os is the way to access env variables, export VARIABLE_NAME="value" is the command to set env variables but set persistent variables you need to put it in a file
# VSC uses non-login shell so .profile is not going to work. MACOS since catalina use zsh, so ~/.zshrc is the file that will load the env
# most important thing: there should be no space around the = sign.



import os

api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
if api_key:
    print(f"API Key retrieved: {api_key}")
else:
    print("API Key not found.")
